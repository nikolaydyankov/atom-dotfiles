Open in Browser Atom.io Package
===============================

A very simple Open in Browser Atom.io Package. This allows you to right click
and have a menu that will open the current file in your default program. That
opens that extension. HTML files will open in your default browser or
application.

Update by "mesosteros"

Replace editor class with atom-text-editor tag.
Shortcut was conflicting with meteor developers who use Ctrl-Alt-M in
Meteor.js packages for Atom, so use Ctrl-Alt-Q instead.
